# MVVM-Movies
This demo project showcases MVVM Clean code architecture to fetch movies data from themoviedb API and display it with Jetpack compose.
This project uses the API from **themoviedb.org** so in order to run this you will need to provide an API key which you can get it from [Here](https://www.themoviedb.org/)<br>
Once you get the API just create a file with name ***apikey.properties*** in the root of the project<br>
````
API_KEY = "Your API Key"
````
As for the implementation you can find : <br>
1. Jetpack compose
2. MVVM Clean Code Architecture (Repository as interface, Repository Impl, ViewModel, Use-Case)
3. Dagger Hilt
4. Nav Controller
5. API Interface for retrofit
